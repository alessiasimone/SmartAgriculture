# SmartAgriculture
Cyber-physical systems, introduced during the fourth industrial revolution, are now a crucial point on the path to the fifth industrial revolution. Along with the smart home, smart agriculture represents one of the most important fields of application. This research aims to connect both application fields by implementing an intelligent device that succeeds in
automatically activating an irrigation system for greenhouses, indoor and outdoor plants and gardens through a machine-learning algorithm.
